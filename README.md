## Installing dependency
I suggest all the developers who are installing dependency to this project, please use `yarn` and not npm. I've already installed some of the core dependency with yarn. Mixing things up with npm will cause issues during production builds. So please, I cannot stress this enough. Use 'yarn' if you're installing any dependencies. If you don't have yarn installed on your machine, follow instructions here: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable
